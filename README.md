# 60_Hurdles

This Repository Of Mine Is about the journey of my **Logic Building** 
like the things: 
    -Where i struggled.
    -What i have improved.
    -What more left.
I commit that I will follow these **Rules** in these 60 days-
      -No ctrl+c and ctrl+v.
      -Logic first with pen paper.
      -Daily reflections.

**GOAL-**
    *To train my Thinking so i can code it up on my own.*
